Administrative Updates

So far into the project, the responsibilities and tasks are still split evenly and have the same roles mentioned from the project plan between Jigon Kim and Neel Roy. Both members have evenly split coding and documentation tasks throughout the project so far. We will continue to store files and our work in our GitHub repository and also continue to write our reports in markdown format for readability and consistency. We are still using the same datasets from our project plan, which are the World population by country database and the Cost of living index by country database. The World population by country dataset has demographic information of a country, such as population size in 2023 and 2024, area in km2, growth rate, density in km2, percentage of world population, and ranking. Each row in this dataset represents a country, so there are over 200+ rows in this dataset. The Cost of Living Index dataset contains statistical information for each country in the world in 2024. This includes the cost of living index, rent index, cost of living plus rent index, groceries index, restaurant index, and local purchasing power index. Our research question remains the same as the project plan: Do countries with smaller populations tend to have a higher cost of living and what others factors contribute to cost of living? This will guide to see if there are any correlations between any factors. 

One thing to note about these datasets is that they were found on Kaggle and have a Public Domain license, meaning that we were able to obtain and analyze the data freely without any restrictions on accessing the data. We were also able to combine the datasets together by country name and this leads us to do deeper analysis later on.

Task Updates

Some of the tasks we have done so far are combining datasets using Python and pandas (modules 7-8), data collection and acquisition (module 3), data cleaning (module 10), and ethical data handling (module 2). We were able to do these tasks in the IS 477.ipynb file. We created a new CSV file where we merged the two datasets together so that we could conduct our analysis. We also noticed the dataset include information about the population in 2023, but we are only interested for the population in 2024. Because of this, we removed the population 2023 column but kept all of the other columns. We decided to keep the other columns because even though we are only focused on the population and cost of living index, the other columns could help us see patterns that could help with our analysis and research. This status report is written in a Markdown file so that it would be readable to the public. 


Updated  Timeline

We will still follow the timeline described in the project plan. We have so far done [insert tasks]. However, we still need to do certain tasks before the December 10th, 2025, deadline, which include: [insert tasks].
