Administrative Updates

So far into the project, the responsibilities and tasks are still split evenly and have the same roles mentioned from the project plan between Jigon Kim and Neel Roy. Both members have evenly split coding and documentation tasks throughout the project so far, as we have done before with the project plan. We will continue to store files and our work in our GitHub repository, and also continue to write our reports in markdown format for readability and consistency. We are still using the same datasets from our project plan, which are the World population by country database and the Cost of living index by country database. The World population by country dataset has demographic information of a country, such as population size in 2023 and 2024, area in km2, growth rate, density in km2, percentage of world population, and ranking. Each row in this dataset represents a country, so there are over 200+ rows in this dataset. The Cost of Living Index dataset contains statistical information for each country in the world in 2024. This includes the cost of living index, rent index, cost of living plus rent index, groceries index, restaurant index, and local purchasing power index. Our research question changed from the project plan. Our new question states: Do countries with smaller populations tend to have a higher cost of living, and what other factors contribute to the cost of living? This will guide us to see if there are any correlations between any factors. More information is available in the project updates section. We still have the same Temporal Constraint and Data Granularity. The Temporal Constraint comes from our datasets since they only contain information from 2024. The Data Granularity comes from unknown factors such as people’s income in a country, their GDP, etc. 

One thing to note about these datasets is that they were found on Kaggle and have a Public Domain license, meaning that we were able to obtain and analyze the data freely without any restrictions on accessing the data. Something we noticed about the datasets is that the data comes from Numbeo, which is the world's largest cost-of-living database. This is a very credible source. We were also able to combine the datasets together by country name, and this leads us to conduct deeper analysis later on.

Task Updates

Some of the tasks we have done so far are combining datasets using Python and pandas (modules 7-8), data collection and acquisition (module 3), data cleaning (module 10), and ethical data handling (module 2). We were able to do these tasks in the Analysis.ipynb file. We also created a new CSV file where we merged the two datasets together so that we could conduct our analysis. The merged dataset includes information about the population in 2023, but we are only interested in the population in 2024. Because of this, we removed the 2023 population column but retained all the other columns. Originally, we decided to keep the other columns because we are only focused on the population of 2024 and the cost of living index. But after we added a component to our question, we noticed that the other columns could help us see patterns that could help with going deeper with our analysis and research. Thankfully, neither dataset contained null values or incomplete values, so no extensive data cleaning was necessary. The only cleaning we did with the merged dataset was dropping the 2023 population column.

Regards to our GitHub page, this status report is written in a Markdown file so that it would be readable to the public. We have also made 2 new folders that contain the datasets and visualizations we use. All changes and commits will be done equally by group members.

Updated Timeline

So far, we are still going with the original timeline plan, and we will continue following the timeline outlined in the project plan. To date, we have completed Python and pandas (modules 7-8), data collection and acquisition (module 3), data cleaning (module 10), storage and organization (modules 4- 5), and ethical data handling (module 2). However, there are specific tasks remaining before the December 10th, 2025, deadline, which include: Data lifecycle (module 1), extraction and enrichment (module 6), data quality (module 9), workflow automation and provenance (modules 11-12), and metadata and data documentation. We will have these tasks completed at least a week before the December 10th deadline to allow us to check over and revise our work if necessary. As mentioned before, the responsibilities are still being done equally and will continue that way until the end of the project.


Project Plan Updates

One major thing that has changed in the Project Plan is our research question. Originally, our question was “Do countries with smaller populations tend to have a higher cost of living?”, but we added a component to that question to “Do countries with smaller populations tend to have a higher cost of living, and what other factors contribute to the cost of living?” We decided to add another component of the research question, so that it can allow us to explore more of the dataset and conduct deeper analysis and research. Another reason why we added another component of our research question is that the dataset contains columns that could allow us to explore correlations with variables and use those columns to uncover potential hidden features and correlations. Doing this also made us drop columns that were irrelevant to our research, such as dropping the population size of 2023 column, since we are only focused on the population of 2024. Other than adding a component to our research question, no other major updates have occurred. By the end of this project, we will have constructed visualizations and analysis code that will help show the public the answer to our research question and show how this is helpful for future work. Project work and responsibilities will still be split evenly amongst group members, the same way we have done so far.
