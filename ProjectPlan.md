Project Plan
Neel Roy and Jigon Kim

Overview: This project will see whether or not the population size of a country had an influence on the cost of living across different countries in the year 2024. While using global datasets that include each nation’s country population, cost of living index, and other demographic data, this project will help to identify if smaller populations are linked to higher living costs. Doing this could uncover global trends that reveal how a country’s population density, economy, and standards of living interact with one another.

Research Question(s): Do countries with smaller populations tend to have a higher cost of living?

Around the world, the cost of living in a country can depend on a lot of factors, such as the state of the economy of the country, growth rate, grocery prices, etc. Smaller population sizes are known to have high living costs, while larger populations may have more affordable living costs despite their population sizes. With this research question in mind, the goal of this project is to see if there is a correlation that links the population size of a country to the cost of living and find the reason why this may be true. This could help people better understand how populations influence the cost of living across different countries.

Datasets: 

World population by country database

This dataset has demographic information of a country such as population size in 2023 and 2024, area in km2, growth rate, density in km2, percentage of world population, and ranking. Each row in this dataset represents a country so there are over 200+ rows in this dataset. This dataset was found through Kaggle.com. 

Cost of living index by country database

This dataset contains statistical information of each country in the world in 2024. This includes cost of living index, rent index, cost of living plus rent index, groceries index, restaurant index, and local purchasing power index. Each row also represents a country and was also found through Kaggle.com. 


Team: For this project, we have two people working on the team: Jigon Kim and Neel Roy. Both of us will split the work and responsibilities equally for the project. Some responsibilities include documenting our work, data analysis, obtaining the data, and submitting the final project. For the project plan, Neel Roy will find the datasets we will be working on for the project and Jigon Kim will document and planout the project. After finding the datasets to work with, we will both come up with research questions to answer based on the given data and analysis we can do. For the Interim Status Report, we will have done analysis on the datasets and have begun to answer our research question. After that, we will finish up the project by working together more on analyzing the data and documenting any updates or changes we did along the way. Doing this will then prepare us for the final submission of the project. We will also make sure that we document where we got the datasets, mention potential future analysis, and how we found our findings. As mentioned before, all responsibilities will be split evenly.


Timeline: We will use the major due dates as the background of our timeline. This project plan is due October 14th, 2025. During this phase, we will mainly discuss our research question, show what datasets we will work with, and introduce the team members for this project. The second phase is the Interim Status report. In this phase, we give an update of the project so far and what work we have done so far. This is also an opportunity to introduce any updates in our timeline or anything else we have changed. By this time, we want to have conducted analysis, have findings, think about future findings, and start working on visualizations. It would also be important to document our findings and how we found our findings during this process. The due date for the Interim report is November 11th, 2025 so we have about a month to work on the project after the project plan. Finally, the final phase is the Final project submission due on December 10th, 2025. This will be a report summarizing our project and submitting all the work we have done for the project such as visualizations, data, completing citations, and results. Throughout the timeline, the work will be done by both contributors in the team.

Constraints: There are a few things that limit what we can say about the results.First, there's a Temporal Constraint because all the data is just from 2024. We can only talk about what's true right now. We can't say anything about why costs are changing over time or how population trends affect things in the long run. Second, we're limited by Data Granularity. All the numbers are at the national level. We don't have detailed stuff like what people actually earn, or how grocery costs differ within a huge country. This means we can't really dig into the true "reason why." Third, we have to trust the Index Methodology Reliance. We're using indices calculated by a third party, so any issues or biases in how they made those cost of living scores will be in our project, too. Finally, Sample Size and Bias is a practical constraint. We'll only use countries that show up in both files, and if we drop a lot of countries, especially small ones, our sample might be biased.

Gaps: To make a robust analysis, there are two major gaps we need to consider. The biggest issue is the Missing Macroeconomic Variables. We're missing the economic indicators that are the biggest causes of cost of living differences. Things like GDP per capita, average income/wages, and inflation rates are essential. The CLI only tells half the story. If a country has a high CLI but also high wages, it might not be a problem. We need that income data.
The second gap is figuring out what to do with the Refinement of Dependent Variables. We have a bunch of sub-indices like Rent Index and Groceries Index. Right now, the plan just focuses on the main CLI. We need to decide if we should do separate, deep-dive analyses for each of those sub-indices, or if we should just use them as secondary info in our main model. The scope needs to be clearly defined here. Lastly, to make sense of any correlation we find, we'll need to do some background research to gather Missing Domain-Specific Context on trade, economic theory, and national policies that affect pricing in small countries.
